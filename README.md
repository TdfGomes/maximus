## Why Maximus?

We noticed that there are several packages that provide functionalities using functional programming, the Maximus objective is not to overlay robust tools like [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) and [Lodash](https://lodash.com/), but for cases where you don't need everything that is offered in these great and appreciated packages.

Some utilities are repeated in the projects we work on and are commonly necessary to rewrite or copy-paste.

Based on this, we aim to focus on small utilities to facilitate the use of functional approach, manipulation of Arrays and Objects.
